# Tales of Shadowland MMORPG Server

## Overview

The Tales of Shadowland MMORPG server is a high-performance game server designed to support 10,000 concurrent players with a 60 FPS tick rate and processing 600,000 UDP packets per second. The server is being implemented in Rust to achieve maximum performance while maintaining security and scalability.

## Architecture

The server architecture is designed around the following principles:

- **High Performance**: Zero-allocation, lock-free data structures, batch processing
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, replay protection, integrity checks
- **Scalability**: AOI system, entity pooling, adaptive sync
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Quantization, compression, delta compression
- **Reliability**: Reliable UDP, fragmentation, heartbeat system

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./server/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status

### Current Status

The C# version is functional but has performance limitations that prevent scaling to the target of 10,000 concurrent players. The Rust implementation is planned to address these limitations.

**C# Version:**
- ✅ Most systems implemented
- ⚠️ Performance limitations (GC pauses, allocation overhead)
- ⚠️ Limited to ~1,000 concurrent players
- ⚠️ Packet processing bottleneck at high load

**Rust Version:**
- 🔲 Implementation in progress
- 🔲 Target: 10,000 concurrent players
- 🔲 Target: 600,000 packets/second
- 🔲 Target: 60 FPS stable tick rate

For detailed status information, see [STATUS.md](./server/STATUS.md).

## Roadmap

The implementation is divided into 9 phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core Network Layer (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Phase 2**: Serialization and Compression (Weeks 3-4)
3. **Phase 3**: Security and Encryption (Weeks 5-6)
4. **Phase 4**: Entity System (Weeks 7-8)
5. **Phase 5**: Area of Interest (AOI) System (Weeks 9-10)
6. **Phase 6**: Reliable UDP (Weeks 11-12)
7. **Phase 7**: Authority System (Weeks 13-14)
8. **Phase 8**: Buffs and Debuffs (Weeks 15-16)
9. **Phase 9**: Optimization and Testing (Weeks 17-20)

### Building
```bash
# Build the server
cargo build --release

# Run the server
cargo run --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Configuration
The server configuration is defined in `server-config.json`:
- Network configuration (port, MTU, buffers)
- Security configuration (encryption, integrity, heartbeat)
- Performance configuration (tick rate, timeouts)
- AOI configuration (distances, grid size)
- World origin rebasing configuration (quadrants, scale)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test coverage target: > 95%
- Test all critical paths
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test packet processing
- Test entity system
- Test AOI system
- Test reliable UDP

### Load Tests
- Test with 1,000 concurrent players
- Test with 5,000 concurrent players
- Test with 10,000 concurrent players
- Measure performance metrics

### Stress Tests
- Test under high load
- Test with packet loss
- Test with high latency
- Test with connection failures

## Performance Optimization

### Zero-Allocation
- Use stack allocation where possible
- Pre-allocate buffers
- Use object pooling
- Avoid Vec allocations in hot paths

### Lock-Free
- Use atomic operations
- Use lock-free queues
- Use RCU (Read-Copy-Update) patterns
- Minimize locking overhead

### Async I/O
- Use tokio for async I/O
- Use channels for message passing
- Use futures for concurrent operations
- Avoid blocking operations

### Hardware Acceleration
- Use hardware-accelerated CRC32C
- Use hardware-accelerated encryption (when available)
- Use SIMD for vector operations
- Optimize for CPU cache locality

## Security

### Encryption
- All packets encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- X25519 key exchange for perfect forward secrecy
- Separate TX/RX keys for bidirectional encryption
- Replay protection with 64-position sliding window

### Authentication
- Cookie anti-spoof for DDoS protection
- Integrity system for client verification
- Heartbeat system for connection monitoring
- Certificate rotation for long-term security

### Validation
- Server authority for all game state
- Movement validation
- Action validation
- Anti-cheat checks
